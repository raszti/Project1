 I ve learned the meaning of different tags, how to use them, and where to look for more options. The project was easy so far, but sometimes it is a bit difficult to remember when to use the closing tag, and when just a simple /> or nothing. The new tags i met in this project is the <del>, <sup>, <hr> tags but some websites were useful to find the solutions through text editing examples.
